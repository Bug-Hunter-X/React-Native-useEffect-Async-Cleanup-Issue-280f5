This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside. The cleanup function within `useEffect` might not be called correctly if the component unmounts before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  For example, consider a scenario where you fetch data and update the state: 
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('some-api-endpoint');
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```
If the component unmounts before `fetchData` finishes, the state update might still occur after unmounting, causing errors.
